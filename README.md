# ReMapper Blender Exporter
Go to releases, download the `script.py` from the latest release and put it
somewhere in your computer.

In Blender, open `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install` and navigate to the `script.py`.

Make sure to enable the plugin after installing. After expanding a part of the UI on the side, a tab should show up called `RM Exporter`.
