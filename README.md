# What Is This?
ReMapper Blender Exporter is a companion [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) plugin for [ReMapper](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper) models. It specifically focuses on the [ModelScene](https://github.com/Swifter1243/ReMapper/wiki/Model-Scene) implementation, but the exporter exports objects to `.rmmodel` files in a very general format, representing their positions in the scene.

<ins>The exporter is not a requirement for anything Unity related</ins>, as this is mostly intended for [geometry/environment](https://github.com/Aeroluna/Heck/wiki/Environment) statements. 

# What Version to Use
Different versions of ReMapper work with different versions of the exporter. Here's how:

| Exporter Version | ReMapper Version |
|---|---|
| 0.01...0.03 | 3.0.0 |
| 0.04...0.05 | 3.1.0 |
| 0.06 | 4.0.0 |

# Installation
Go to releases, download the `script.py` from the release you want, and put it somewhere in your computer.

In Blender, open `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons > Install` and navigate to the `script.py`.

Make sure to enable the plugin after installing. After expanding a part of the UI on the side, a tab should show up called `RM Exporter`.
