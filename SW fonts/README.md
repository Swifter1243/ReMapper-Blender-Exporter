## Blender fonts for SW (or whatever else)
Geo and Alagard are the two with the lowest wall count. AHS is low as well, curved letters have a slightly higher count, but shouldn't cause any lag issues.

Handwrite unfortunately, ended up having too many walls per character to be easily used as lyrics. Can be used with environment enhancements. All CAPS only.
